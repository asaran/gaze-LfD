# Code for Statistical Analysis of Gaze Patterns 

Data collected and analyzed as part of the user study cannot be released due to IRB restrictions. However the code for the 2 tasks is included.

(a) Pouring Task <br />
- `pouring/exp1.py`: Percentage of time during entire demo spent fixating on objects, gripper or other parts of workspace 
- `pouring/exp2.py`: Perecentage accuarcy to predict reference frame per keyframe
- `pouring/exp3.py`: Gaze Patterns between Novice and Expert Users
- `pouring/exp4.py`: Gaze-patterns around step KF and non-step KF (KT demos only)
- `pouring/gaze_filtering_demo.py`: A demo file with dummy data for gaze fixation filtering <br /> 

(b) Placement Task <br />
- `placement/exp1.py`: Percentage of time during entire demo spent fixating on objects, gripper or other parts of workspace 
- `placement/exp2.py`: Gaze fixations on bowl and plate for different relative placement strategy
